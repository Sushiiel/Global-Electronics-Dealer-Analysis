# Global Electronics Dealer Data Analysis

This project provides an analysis of a fictitious global electronics dealer dataset. Using SQL queries, Python (with Pandas and SQLite), and Power BI, it explores various business insights, including product types, customer locations, seasonal trends, and delivery performance. The analysis aims to help stakeholders better understand the company's performance, customer distribution, and product preferences.

## Dataset and Analysis Overview

The dataset includes the following files:
- **Products.csv**: Contains details about products, including names and categories.
- **Customers.csv**: Stores customer location information.
- **Sales.csv**: Holds order data, including order dates, delivery dates, and revenue.
- **Data_Dictionary.csv**: Provides descriptions and data types for each field across the dataset, serving as a reference for data consistency.
- **Exchange_Rates.csv**: Contains historical exchange rates for converting revenue values to a common currency.
- **Stores.csv**: Details information on the companyâ€™s store locations, which is useful for regional analysis and customer demographics.

The analysis addresses five key questions:
1. **What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located?**
2. **Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume?**
3. **What is the average delivery time in days, and has that changed over time?**
4. **What are the most common types of products purchased by customers in each region?**
5. **How does the customer distribution vary by product type or category?**

## Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key insights and trends, enabling interactive exploration of the dataset. The dashboard includes:

- **Product Category Analysis**: A breakdown of products by category to identify popular items.
- **Customer Location Distribution**: A map showing customer distribution across different regions.
- **Monthly and Quarterly Revenue Trends**: Line and bar charts to identify revenue patterns over time.
- **Average Delivery Time Trends**: Visuals to monitor changes in delivery performance.
- **Regional Product Preferences**: Insights into product popularity by region.

The Power BI dashboard enhances data comprehension and supports decision-making by allowing stakeholders to interact with the data.
